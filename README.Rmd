This course is different than old school courses as it let the students learn on their own and go ahead. Various data science topics and their implementations in R is really helpful and learning opportunity for people belonging from different academic fields. 
I am hoping and wishing to learn alot about the clusterin, classification and different data analysis methodologies through this course.
